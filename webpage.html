    <h1>Conspiracy Theories</h1>

    <h2>What Are Conspiracy Theroies?</h2>
    <p>A conspiracy theory is an explanation of an event or situation that invokes a train of open thoughts. They are what many people obsess over and can be very real to certain people. They can sometimes involve an illegal or harmful act carried out by government or other powerful people in the world. There are many conspiracy theroies out try to explain or make people think about different things that go on in the world. Some people believe in them while others think that they aren't true. People can make some farfetched or seemingly untrue for obvious reasons while others may be believeable. They can be about many different topics, like politics, celeberties, major events, and tradgeties. You never know if they're true, no matter how weird they may be. </p>

<h3>Making Connections</h3>
<p>Christopher French, a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths, University of London, explains why we believe in conspiracy theroies.
Although conspiracy beliefs can occasionally be based on a rational analysis of the evidence, most of the time they are not. As a species, one of our greatest strengths is our ability to find meaningful patterns in the world around us and to make causal inferences. We sometimes, however, see patterns and causal connections that are not there, especially when we feel that events are beyond our control.</p>

<h2>Types of Theroies</h2>
<h3>Event Conspiracy Theories.</h3>
  <p>These types of theroies refer to important and one-of-a-kind historical events. Examples of these may include the Kennedy assassination, how 9/11 happened, and the spread of diseases that lasted for a long time period.</p>

<h3>Systemic Conspiracy Theories.</h3>
<p>These theories pertain to alleged beliefs or accusations on some organization or person dominating a country or the world. Such theories are usually simple, with a single evil organization. Examples may include conspiracy theories about the illuminati.</p>

<h3>Superconspiracy Theories.</h3>
<p>Superconspiracy theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together through possible connections. They usually have one main evil force at the source of it. Many theroies come together to form a much bigger one at the center of it all.</p>
