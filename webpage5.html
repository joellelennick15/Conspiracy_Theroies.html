<p>This is what a Subliminal Message would look like at a slower speed in terms of the message "Read Me."<p>
<h2>What are Subliminal Messages</h2>
    <p>A subliminal message is a signal or message designed to be able to be seen by people, but not have them know about the message. It could be inaudible to the conscious mind, but audible to the unconscious mind, or might be an image transmitted quickly and seen unconsciously. This definition assumes a division between conscious and unconscious which may be misleading; it may be more true to suggest that the subliminal message (sound or image) is perceived by deeper parts of what is a single integrated mind. Everyday, subliminal techniques are used in advertising.</p>

    <h2>Subliminal Messages in Advertising</h2>

<p>Many "hidden" messages go into movies and TV programs. There is a concept of "moving pictures" that relies on persistence of vision to create the illusion of movement in a series of images. They are shown too fast for the eye to actually make the conscious mind aware that it saw the image, but the subconscious mind still registers it. This can still cause some effect on the viewer, in terms of behavior. This is a popular theory of subliminal messages and it usually suggests that subliminal commands can be inserted into this sequence at the rate of 1 frame in 25 (or roughly 1 frame per second).</p>

<h2>Do We Use Them?</h2>

<p> The current goal with marketing professionals is that subliminal advertising is counter-productive. Some people believe this is because they want it to be ineffective, because they realise it would be a public relations disaster if its use was discovered.</p>
