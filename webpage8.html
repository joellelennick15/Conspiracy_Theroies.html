    <h1>9/11 Conspiracy Theroies</h1>

    <h2>9/11</h2>
    <p>On September 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the Unites States by flying two planes into two skyscrapers at the World Trade Center in New York City. The buildings caught on fire from the crash and collapsed. Another plane destroyed part of the Pentagon, while the fourth plane crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Officials believe that the terrorists on that plane intended to destroy either the White House or the U.S. Capitol. Passengers on the plane fought the terrorists and prevented them from reaching their goal. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the 9/11 attacks.</p>

    <p>Following 9/11, the U.S. government took many steps to try to make the country safer. It tightened security at airports and in public buildings. A new cabinet-level department—the Department of Homeland Security—was created, which works to protect the United States from terrorism.</p>

    <h2>Organized</h2>
    <p>The main theroy on 9/11 is that the current president at the time, George Bush, and the government knew about 9/11 and might have organized it. The reason would be their wanting to go to war with Afganistan and Iraq. The attack would be the reason for the war being started.</p>

  <h2>The Collapse</h2>
  <p>The first theroy to branch off of the main one, is that the World Trade Center did not actually collapse because the planes hit it. Instead, some say it looked as if the collapse was from a controlled demolition. When a controlled demolition happens, bombs are placed on each floor of the building and are set off in order to have it fall straight down. The way the Trade Center fell and the order of the explosions, can look like a controlled demolition. It may also seem odd that one plane crashing into a building can cause the whole thing to fall.</p>

  <h2>The Pentagon</h2>
  <p>When one of the planes hit the Pentagon, there was a hole left from the collision. The hole in the Pentagon was much smaller than an actual commercial plane. A plane is 125 feet long, yet the hole that was left was only 16 feet long. Some say that the hole that was shown was actually from a missile that was flown into The Pentagon, and that it was made to look like a plane. Theroists also say that the plane would've been shot down if it came anywhere near The Pentagon in the first place.</p>

  <h2>Flight 93</h2>
  <p>Flight 93 was one of the flights that was hijacked by the terroists and was going to crash and kill everyone on board. The passengers of the plane decided to get up and fight back against them, trying to outnumber the terrorists and take control of the plane. The plane did eventually crash into the ground in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.</p>

  <h3>The Truth</h3>
  <p>One of the theroies about flight 93 is that the passengers never tried to overtake the plane. Instead, the plane was shot down. The actual crash site had very little debris, with just a big crater. Later, there was debris found ten miles away from the supposed crash site.</p>

  <h3>Safe Landing</h3>
  <p>The second theroy about flight 93 is that the plane actually landed safely and that all of the people who were on the plane were taken and executed. The actual crash in the ground is just a missle to make us think the plane crashed. A lot of phone calls were made from passengers to their loved ones from the plane. But in 2001, and even now, cellphones would not work in the sky. Also,the passengers would call and say their full name before talking, which is a little odd.</p>

  <h2>Crisis Actors</h2>
  <p>The final theroy is about crisis actors. Crisis actors are people who pretend to be victims, or that they were at the event when they go on the news to tlk about it. In reality, they're actors and they go from event to event with a differnet wig, glasses, or facial features.</p>

  <p>Below is a video of a crisis actor from 9/11.</p>
